Q. Why normal GANS are insufficient, and how do you overcome that inability?
A. GANs learn "incomplete" representation BECAUSE of single-pathway framework,
what they've done is create a second reconstruction path, "generation sideway"
for maintaining the completeness of the learned embedding space. Proposition
is that these TWO learning pathways compete in a parameter-sharing manner.
Clearly, for some reason, this ain't working.
